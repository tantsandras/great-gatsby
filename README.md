## üöÄ Great Gatsby, the SPACE EXPLORER

### Live at: https://great-gatsby-space-explorer.netlify.com/

## üßê What is it?

It's a little ufo game where you can steer a ufo with your mouse and try to avoid getting hit by comets. 

I made it to practice canvas and gatsbyjs, and also because, you know, space. 

It's made with React.
